What this is, how it works

Right now you do the following:

* add stuff to the entries in topics/ directory, number it according to
  where you want it showin in the output
* run q_and_a.py > new-html-file.html
* check that you like the results
* profit

Should do: don't hardcode the topics dir path, the template filenames,
te intro path. make 'em all defaults, fine. but allow user to specify
